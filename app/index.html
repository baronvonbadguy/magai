                Serving the needs of unabashed tree lovers,
                their neighbors &amp; governments by providing
                a preventative, holistic approach to 
                tree care. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We specialize in assessing the structural integrity of large,
                old trees, and have extensive experience designing and
                installing dynamic cabling systems. The majority of our 
                customers are homeowners, but we occasionally preform 
                formal risk assessments, oversee tree-sensitive construction
                sites and deliver expert opinions for municipalities,
                businesses and educational institutions. 
                <br><br>
                In large tree care companies, a complicated chain of 
                comman often results in mistakes and cookie-cutter
                solutions. Becuase we are a very small company of
                articulate and educated employees, we are able to 
                safeguard the trees we work on while providing

              With a family background in engineering, undergraduate work in math and chemistry, and 
              a degree in dance and literature from Bennington College, Jack Magai started working in 
              the tree care field in 1985. He started pruning trees in Seattle in the 90â€™s and became 
              certifed as an arborist by the International Society of Aboraculture (ISA) in 1997. He 
              has studied tree mechanics with Claus Mattheck, and recently became qualifed by the 
              ISA in Tree Risk Assessment. Under his other hat he has been making and preforming 
              dance-based works for 30 years. He has two sons with the writer Amy Halloran.
