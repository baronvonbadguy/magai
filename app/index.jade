                                Serving the needs of unabashed tree lovers,
                                their neighbors &amp; governments by providing
                                a preventative, holistic approach to

                                We specialize in assessing the structural integrity of large,
                                old trees, and have extensive experience designing and
                                installing dynamic cabling systems. The majority of our 
                                customers are homeowners, but we occasionally preform 
                                formal risk assessments, oversee tree-sensitive construction
                                sites and deliver expert opinions for municipalities,
                                businesses and educational institutions.

                                In large tree care companies, a complicated chain of 
                                comman often results in mistakes and cookie-cutter
                                solutions. Becuase we are a very small company of
                                articulate and educated employees, we are able to 
                                safeguard the trees we work on while providing

                            the tree care field in 1985. He started pruning trees in Seattle in the 90â€™s and became
